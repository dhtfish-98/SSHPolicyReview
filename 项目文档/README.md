> 目录已整理：文档在「项目文档」，暂存与缓存放在「Build」。本仓发布源码版；`python3 构建.py --build` 会返回 `OPEN_MANUAL_ADAPTER`，不生成安装包。运行源码命令前先执行 `python3 构建.py --stage --ci`，再进入 `Build/源码`。暂存会恢复原输入路径。现有版本和历史验证记录按各自提交理解。

# SSHPolicyReview

**Source version:** [v0.1.0](https://github.com/dhtfish-98/SSHPolicyReview/releases/tag/v0.1.0) ([release scope](RELEASES.md)); GitHub source archives only.

Review selected explicit global settings in an owner-supplied sshd_config. It runs locally, does not contact targets, and reports review prompts instead of exploit instructions.

## Input and checks

- Input: sshd_config from a system you own or are authorized to inspect.
- Checks: Global root login, password authentication, empty passwords and X11 forwarding set to yes.
- Output: rule, local location and short note. No source snippets, credential values or log identities are printed.

## Run

```sh
python cli.py ./owned-input
python cli.py ./owned-input --json
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Exit code 0 means no findings, 1 means review findings, 2 means invalid input or read failure. A clean result is not a security guarantee. The input file is read through a bounded regular-file descriptor with a 4 MiB limit.

## Boundaries

Include files, Match predicates, defaults, command-line overrides and server-effective configuration are not evaluated. Work only on local, authorized inputs. The analysis does not send data to a service or modify the inspected files.

## Source and policy context

- Technical reference: https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config
- See [ORIGIN.md](<ORIGIN.md>) for implementation provenance and [VALIDATION.md](<VALIDATION.md>) for checks performed.
- CVP eligibility depends on a real, legitimate defensive task affected by Claude's cyber safeguards and the applicant's organization/identity review; this repository alone does not establish eligibility or approval. [Anthropic CVP guidance](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/14604842-real-time-cyber-safeguards-on-claude-opus-and-sonnet).

## Reviewed input behavior

Quoted selected values and equals separators are interpreted. Include directives remain explicit unresolved findings; selected declarations in Match sections are reviewed without asserting which connections match them.
